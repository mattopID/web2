The face filter, which is called anime style, first appeared on the app earlier this. It�s never been so easy to liven up your zoom video calls, thanks to snapchat�s snap camera. The filter was released by snapchat last week and immediately became a hit.</p>

<p>It’ll automatically recognize your face within. Then select settings by tapping on the gear icon and choose filters &amp; lenses. Enter the snapchat camera screen and hit your profile icon. Anime filter is the newest in a long list of memes created from transforming images and videos of your face. It turns your face into the likeness of an anime character—and the results are pretty wild.</p>
