<p>A television anime of my love story!! Have you read the manga? (俺物語!!ore monogatari!!?, lett.la mia storia!!) è un manga shōjo scritto da kazune kawahara e disegnato da aruko, serializzato sul bessatsu margaret di shūeisha dal 13 aprile 2012 al 13 luglio 2016.un adattamento anime, prodotto dalla madhouse, è stato trasmesso in giappone tra l�8 aprile e il 23 settembre 2015, mentre un film live action basato sulla serie è uscito. Her other works include yasuko to kenji, and her hobbies include laughing and getting lost. Overall, despite how great the anime and manga versions were, i found ore monogatari to just be an okay movie.</p>
