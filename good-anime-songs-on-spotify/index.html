<p>The 25 best anime theme songs ever. Musicians near and far have worked hard to bring their passion for the kingdom hearts iii soundtrack to life and make it available on spotify. Here is a list of some highly regarded endings that are iconic to the medium of anime. If your file isn’t supported, we do our best to match it with songs from the spotify catalog. Besides there�s good anime with good soundtracks and songs (including openings, endings, soundtracks and even songs peformed by the voice actors as his/her character), but all of these are missing on spotify.</p>
