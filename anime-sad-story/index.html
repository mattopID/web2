<p>Clannad is one of the best anime to make you cry and sad. The twenty-three-episode-long Clannad and its infinitely more depressing follow-up the twenty-four-episode-long Clannad. Clannad and its sequel Clannad. The story starts around with a depressed guy who attends a new high school and met a girl who completely changed his life. Heres some soundtracks that have emotional songs I might include more than one song for each soundtrack.</p>
