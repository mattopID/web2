<p>Edited by hylarn on aug 13th 2020 at 7:02:21 am Anime tropes have been around since the beginning of the medium and are used as a tool to point out a series’ motif. The anime airs within the oha suta children�s morning tv program and will receive a simultaneous manga serialization by kazumata oguri. A teaser trailer for both the anime adaptation and game adaptation was published by toei animation and can be found below. Again, video game adaptations usually fall flat, but at least there’s nothing to suggest this one will be any worse than average.</p>
