<p>Dragonball manga stood alone for long before they came into printing. Call the list my favorite anime of all time or my top ten greatest anime. More than ten of these films are also in the top 50 traditional animated films. 20 of the best mature anime of all time. Pokémon is the most represented animated film franchise, with seven films on.</p>

<p>While all three of these series diverged pretty drastically in their methods, storytelling, and overall conclusions (or lack thereof with one piece), they also all sold. Enjoy the beautiful art of anime on your screen. Overrated hype, to be precise. The final act) based on the rest of the original manga story. If it continues it will be the best anime of all time which also will include the best arc of all time.</p>

<p>Kôsuke toriumi , daiki yamashita , jun fukushima , ayaka suwa Didn�t know you liked vandread. The comments r so cringe all this was was a list saying popular anime not best but u guys go and say my top ten anime 1. Some of the qualifying factors taken into consideration for a series being deemed great are, entertainment value, popularity, lasting appeal, quality of writing, originality and significance to the medium of anime.
