<p>Samurai Champloo is a pretty obvious recommendation for people who like Cowboy Bebop. But this is samurai and swords not gun play. Michiko is a sexier and more feminine version of Revy and Black Lagoon is simply a more hard-boiled concept of underworld life than MtH. The characters in this series are amazing and just like in Cowboy Bebop they are rich with both positive and negative traits which make them so alive. It takes the gunplay up a notch and is full of plentiful Hollywood references.</p>
