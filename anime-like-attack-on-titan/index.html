<p>Black Bullet just like Attack On Titan has a similar theme it focuses on. The story takes place during the industrial revolution except a virus is killing people. Like Attack on Titan Shingeki no Bahamut Genesis also has some medieval elements in the anime. In an attempt to fight back against the Gastrea the Civil Security. The similarity occurs where the main character is infected.</p>

<p>Answer 1 of 44. There are so many other anime similare to shingeki no kyojin that. While Attack on Titan is still getting bashed for MAPPA as the animation studio we cant deny that Wit studio did an awesome job in animating the previous seasons. The story takes place during the industrial revolution except a virus is killing people. Humanity is on the verge of extinction because of Aragami man-eating monsters that can only be killed by a special type of weapon called God Arc.</p>

<p>That figures how similar they are. The good guys use vampires to fight the bad vampires kind of like how Eren is used to fight the Titans. The story takes place during the industrial revolution except a virus is killing people. Thus with lots of action-packed episodes its the perfect anime for dark fantasy anime lovers. In an attempt to fight back against the Gastrea the Civil Security.</p>
