<p>While Attack on Titan is still getting bashed for MAPPA as the animation studio we cant deny that Wit studio did an awesome job in animating the previous seasons. With Yûki Kaji Marina Inoue Josh Grelle Yui Ishikawa. It also has a lot of action scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat while maintaining a comedic tone throughout. Like Attack on Titan the characters are all complex with interesting personalities and moral alignments. However the titans in this anime are less frightening and more fun similar to the art style of AOT.</p>

<p>This anime is more like Attack on Titan and it revolves around human-eating monsters called Kabane. And that Eren being with Mikasa in chapter 138 was another failed timeline as was chapter 139. This makes it perfect for Black anime lovers. Due to this it has even been noted that a single Titan poses minimal threat to soldiers equipped with ODM gear or a line of cannons with the danger of Titans coming primarily from their numbers. It has vibes of Attack on Titan including friendships being torn apart due to two sides not cooperating with each other.</p>
