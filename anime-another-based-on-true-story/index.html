<p>Yes Dopesick is based on a true story. False claim that hundreds died in the Astroworld Festival tragedy. Fact is usually stranger than fiction but in the case of anime the truth led to things wilder than ever imagined. Yes Dopesick is based on a true story. And Im pretty sure Welcome to the NHK is technically based on a true story since its based on the authors experience as a hikikomori.</p>

<p>The manga provides a fictionalized account of the Warring States period primarily through the experiences of the war orphan Xin and his comrades as he fights to become the greatest general under the heavens and in doing so unifying China for the first time in 500 years. He subsequently lost both his adoptive and real. The semi-autobiographical story was inspired by Nosakas own wartime experiences in 1945 in which his hometown of Kobe was firebombed.
