<p>Pretty common theme but this takes the point to a whole other level. The main characters grow up in a settlement run by vampires who feed off their blood by force. Instead it starts the other way around. Clannad and its highly-praised sequel Clannad. The characters are likable and it is sad whenever they move on to the next life but whenever people say that Angel Beats is the saddest anime it tends to get a bit too much.</p>
