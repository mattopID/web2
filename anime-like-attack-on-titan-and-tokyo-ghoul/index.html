<p>In case you have already watched it and you want something similar check out our list of the best anime like Attack on Titan. Ghouls look like ordinary humans but they have to survive on eating human flesh. On that note dont watch Tokyo Ghoul read it. In Attack On Titan Eren has a secret that he himself is unaware of. I like tokyo ghouls philosphy and more in depth meanings surrounding the animemanga for a mo.</p>
