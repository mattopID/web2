<p>Anime romance school ini berkisah mengenai Mizuno dan Azumi yang berada di kelas yang sama dan saling mengenal satu sama lainnya. Theres something about the story of Kirito and all his friends trapped in a video game with only two methods of escape death or reach the top of the dungeon that is pretty captivating to most people. Aptly nicknamed Demon President by the boys for her strict disciplinary style Misaki Ayuzawa is not afraid to use her. If you like anime and video games youve come to the right place.

<p>The romance comedy anime is hilarious especially as Hachiman tries to balance his narcissistic views with his act of helping others. Memulai hubungan dari sekadar teman hingga saling menyukai hubungan keduanya pun tidak selalu berjalan mulus. Honey and Clover is just a really good anime that happens to be a romance. With that in mind here are my top picks for the best martial arts anime of all time. The original series being a light-hearted romantic comedy Urusei Yatsura Movie 2.</p>
