<p>I felt the novel to be a lot more real and enjoyable than the anime. The manga is only an adaptation of the Light Novels much like the anime is and its by far not as faithful as the anime and even that took someunexpected plot points into the storyline.

The WN and LN are pretty close where most of the changes in the LN are simply extra side-stories.</p>

The anime cut a lot of things of Nebulis especially the political plot. This may become a problem if the anime gets a second season. Another is an anime based upon the Novel and Manga of the same name by Yukito Ayatsuji.</p>

<p>Anime Up to episode 7 the anime is fairly faithful to the original source. I just started reading the light novel from volume 10 wich is apparently where the story continues after the anime ends although Im questioning even that now. Bungo Stray Dogs Gaiden. The anime covers until volume 3 while the manga covers until volume 5. From my memory wich is awful I dont remember anything in the anime at all related to these events or anything leading up.</p>
