<p>ANOTHER anime Mizuno Sanaes Death. If playback doesnt begin shortly try. Based on the 2009 novel of the same name by Yukito Ayatsuji the series is set in 1998 and focuses on a boy named Kōichi Sakakibara who upon transferring into Yomiyama Middle School and meeting the curious Mei Misaki finds himself in a mystery revolving around students and people related to his class facing gruesome and senseless deaths. Meaning they had to be a student headassistant teacher a member of the family who died before they made it to their third year. Horror is not a genre that in my opinion is well represented in anime.</p>
