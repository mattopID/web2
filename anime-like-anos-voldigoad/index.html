<p>If were going to add a character outside of the anime universe then my best pick would be The One Above All. Demon King of Tyranny. Humans killed his mother while she was pregnant with him and he was born from her corpse. Since he possesses some kind of 99x layers of dimensions that acts as his own existence and his source is nothingness. Eventually he gets tired of all wars and battles and decides that the only way to achieve peace is to build walls between the four races hoping that they will forget their grudge after a thousand years or more. In this story the ancient demon king Anos Voldigoad has awoken after centuries to find a soft and lazy demon world so hes determined to reclaim it from the bottom up.</p>
